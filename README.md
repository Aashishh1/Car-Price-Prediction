## About the Project
I developed a machine learning tool that predicts car prices based on various features like manufacturer, engine size, fuel type, year, and mileage. 📊✨  
The project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow from **data cleaning, feature engineering, model training** to **evaluation**.

## Built With Libraries
- 🐍 **Python** – Programming language  
- 📚 **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation and analysis  
- 📊 **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- 🧠 **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models (Linear Regression & Random Forest)

## Results
| Model                  | R² Score | MAE (₹) | RMSE (₹) |
|------------------------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Linear Regression 📝   | 0.69     | 5,882   | 9,094     |
| Random Forest 🌳       | 0.981    | 1,024   | 2,231     |

> ✅ Random Forest performs exceptionally well for predicting car prices.
